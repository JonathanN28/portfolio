	<h2>Our Company</h2>
	<p>George Washington first founded the company in 2020. At first it was a
		 studio to make video games like Table Tennis: Revolution or Valient
		 which is a FPS game promoting magical abilities. As soon as it was
		 released, our competitor, Valorant, overtook in popularity and
		 bankrupted the studio. Washington led careful measures to ensure the
		 studio stayed alive. He transformed the studio into a company focusing
		 on the community of Valorant. In 2022, it became the first offical Riot
	Games partner to distribute Valorant Points. With the Valorant playerbase
		 flocking towards our company, we were able to gain momentum and the
		 funds to continue our journey.</p>
	<p>We create video games, sell VP, and host ourselves as the official
		 Valorant forums.</p>
